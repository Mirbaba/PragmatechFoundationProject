    <p>Hi, my name is Mirbaba. The contents in this website is less about me, but more <i>about my friend - <b><i>Aqil</i></b></i>. We met each-other back when we were at university, we've been groupmates. He was interested in mobile photography back then and he's good at it. I wanna get you guys acquainted with his photography. Without further ado let's <a href="works.html">watch his works.</a></p>
